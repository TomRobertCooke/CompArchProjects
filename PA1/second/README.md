second

This is the second program of programming assignment 1.
This program receives a file path as input in the terminal.
This file will be some form of a text document that contains instructions for the implementation of a linked list.
Each line will either be an instruction to delete a node or insert a node.
These nodes are inserted in ascending order.
The list is printed as the output of this program.
The program first prints the length of the linked list, and then prints all of the unique items in the list.
The duplicate items will be skipped.
